## Introduction
Predicting the outcome of loan applications is crucial for financial institutions to minimize risk and optimize lending processes. This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict whether a loan application will be approved or rejected based on applicant data.

---

## Project Overview
This project aims to:
1. Analyze loan application data to identify key factors influencing loan approval.
2. Build machine learning models to predict loan outcomes.
3. Provide insights to improve decision-making in loan approval processes.

---

## Workflow
The project follows this workflow:

1. **Data Collection:** Gather loan application data from a reliable source.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean, transform, and prepare the dataset for analysis.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualize data to identify patterns and correlations.
4. **Feature Engineering:** Select and engineer features to improve model performance.
5. **Model Building:** Train and test machine learning models like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and XGBoost.
6. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
7. **Deployment (Optional):** Deploy the best-performing model as an API for real-time predictions.
